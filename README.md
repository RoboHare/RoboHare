### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a software developer from the UK. I have been involved in web technologies for many years and more recently professionally involved in backend programming for a 3D rendering engine. 

My intentions are to create content to better hone my skills as well as share with the community in the form of blog posts and video tutorials. I want to help others in their daily development lives and promote better practices and skill sharing.

I have a passion for all things science, for arts, for music, history and philosophy. Day to day I strive toward the persistent pursuit of knowledge around new technologies and processes. I have a keen eye for design as well as optimised, clean, readable and practical code. Though I have a love of theory, I have pragmatic values and aim toward as lean approach as possible without compromising quality.
